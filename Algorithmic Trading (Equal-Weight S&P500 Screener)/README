This is my first personal project on algorithmic trading. 

Note:
- Data collected is from a sandbox API (ie. Data is random)

What I've learnt:
- Algorithmic Trading Process is broken down generally into these steps:
  1. Collecting Data
  2. Developing a hypothesis for a strategy
  3. Backtesting the strategy
  4. Implement strategy in production
