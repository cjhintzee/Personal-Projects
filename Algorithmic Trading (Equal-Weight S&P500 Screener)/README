This is my first personal project on algorithmic trading. 

The strategy for this project is assigning equal weights to all the companies in the S&P500. 
The hypothesis for this strategy is that smaller-cap stocks may have more room for growth or are more likely to be mispriced, compared to the mega-cap stocks that dominate the S&P 500's market-cap-weighted index.

How this hypothesis may work:
Diversification of Risk: Equal-weighting reduces the concentration of risk by spreading it evenly across all 500 companies, limiting the dominance of large-cap stocks.
Smaller-Cap Exposure: The strategy increases exposure to mid- and small-cap stocks, potentially leading to higher returns compared to large-cap stocks over certain periods.

What I've learnt:
- Algorithmic Trading Process is broken down generally into these steps:
  1. Collecting Data
  2. Developing a hypothesis for a strategy
  3. Backtesting the strategy
  4. Implement strategy in production

How I can improve this project:
- Purchasing an API that allows for batch calls (optimises the speed at which the data is collected)
