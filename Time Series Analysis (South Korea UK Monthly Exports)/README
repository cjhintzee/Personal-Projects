This project was part of my admissions test into a quant finance society in my school.

The main purpose of the test was to determine if applicants had some prior understanding of coding out a TSA, with little emphasis on the actual hypothesis of the strategy.

This TSA was done on SK's Monthly Exports (in USD billions) against time (MM/YY), and its hypothesis is that we could use past exports data to predict future data.

As you can see from the results of the model, the hypothesis clearly needs more refining. However, it was a great exposure and experience for me into the world of quant finance.
